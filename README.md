## My process

I took this step by step and remembered to fundamentals I learned. Using flexbox and many divs helped structure all elements on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

For most of what I learnt had to do with learning how to center the divs and using flexbox those were the hardest to figure out even though I have done this challenge previously. Some things came quickly and some I had to research how to do. I had a hard time removing the scroll bar I eventually figured it out.




### Continued development

I used flexbox alot and I really hope to learn more about using this for alighing items.

I had to use the Dev tools in chrome to find out why the div had not moved from one side of the screen.
